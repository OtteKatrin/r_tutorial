Over the course of this workshop, you can work on exercises to train the theoretical knowledge acquired in the chapters. Most of these exercises will use the [`characters` data set](https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/documentation/), which provides psychometric ratings for many different TV characters. A large number of people rated different TV characters on a personality scale developed by the author of the questionnaire.

You will load the data, prepare it for analyses and plot it in the end, if you follow the whole workshop.
