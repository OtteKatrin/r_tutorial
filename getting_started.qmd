## What is R?

## Installation

## R

## RStudio

### Structure of the RStudio interface

#### Script Pane

#### Console

```{r}
"Hello World!"
```

Tadaa, we just wrote our first line of code.

## First Steps

Some of the most basic things you can do in `R` is are basic mathematical operations. In your `Console`

type the following code lines and press `Enter`.

```{r}
# sum
1 + 2

# substract
2 - 4

# multiply
4 * 4

# divide
3/2
```

By the way: Code lines, that are preceded by a `#` are commented out, and will not be evaluated.

## 4 Workflow

When only coding in our `Console`, we quickly run into the question where to save our code for further evaluation.
