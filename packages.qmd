# Packages

Packages are extensions to the `base R` you get by default. We can compare them somewhat to apps in an appstore:

-   Most of the openly available packages lie on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (Comprehensive R Archive Network). But you can also download packages form other sources, for example [GitHub](https://github.com/). This is what you did when downloading the `tutoR` package in [About this workshop](getting_started.qmd#about-this-workshop).

![](./pictures/app.png){width="19"} Then, we have to load them in each session where we want to use them (like tipping on the app icon): `library(packagename)`.

-   Note that in `install.packages("packagename")` we have to put the package into quotation marks, when calling `library(packagename)` not.
