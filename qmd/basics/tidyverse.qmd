title: "Tidyverse"

The `tidyverse` is a collection of packages following a common philosophy, and facilitate many aspects of coding in R, for example data wrangling and plotting. It is not necessary to learn the `tidyverse` syntax, it differs a bit from the standard R syntax. However, I find it easier to understand in many cases, so I will provide the syntax from the respective `tidyverse` package along with the `Base R` syntax in most cases.

Tidyverse syntax will be marked like this.
