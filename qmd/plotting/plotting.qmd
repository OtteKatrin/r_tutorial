Also show a barplot or something!!

This section is for more experienced R users who want to start plotting with `ggplot2`. It is not necessary to follow the rest of the conference.

This is Zusatz. Plot world map with the winning countries, the more the darker. Same colours for same continents.

Here is our data preparation from the previous chapters:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = world_coordinates, 
       mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = n)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette ="RdBu", direction = -1) + # or direction=1
  ggtitle("Olympic medalists by country") +
  theme_void()

```
