## ifelse

We can also add new values conditionally, for example by using the `ifelse()` function. For example, let's build a composite variable which summarizes whether the category was `Whelchair` or not:

```{r, output.lines = 4}
winners_continents$Wheelchair <- ifelse(
  winners_continents$Category %in% c("Wheelchair Men", "Wheelchair Women"),
  yes = TRUE,
  no = FALSE
)
winners_continents
```

::: tidy
```{r, output.lines = 4}
winners_continents <- winners_continents %>%
  mutate(over_3_h = ifelse(
    winners_continents$Hours < 2,
    yes = "below",
    no  = "over"
  ))

winners_continents
```
