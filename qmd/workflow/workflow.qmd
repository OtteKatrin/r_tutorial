## Workflow

### Scripts

::: callout-warning
When only coding in our [console](#console) we quickly run into the question where to save our code for further evaluation. Therefore, we want to write all our important code into a [script](#script_pane).

### RStudio Projects

Over time, it will become increasingly hard to organize all your files, working directories and workspaces in a reasonable manner. For this, RStudio Projects can be used (highly recommended).

### Exercises

1.  Create a new folder for this tutorial, where all your files will go.
2.  Create a new RStudio project and open it. Go to `File` - `New Project` - `Existing Directory` and select the path of the folder you created in step `1`.
3.  Create a new R Script by clicking on `File` - `New File` - `R Script`. Save it in you folder.

::: callout-tip
Within your project folder create a folder named `R`, where all your R Scripts will go. You can do the same for `data`, `plots` etc. later on. This will help you to structure your working directory.
