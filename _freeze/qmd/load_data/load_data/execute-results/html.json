Sometimes, we will have to use additional packages to get access to that function, mainly `readxl` and `haven`.\n\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Data.type                |Import                       |Export                        |\n|:------------------------|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------|\n|R objects (.Rdata, .rda) |````load()````               |````save()````                |\n|single R object (.Rds)   |````readRDS()````            |````saveRDS()````             |\n|text-files (.txt)        |````read.table()````         |````write.table()````         |\n|.csv-files (.csv)        |````read.csv()````           |````write.csv()````           |\n|Excel-files (.xlsx)      |````readxl::read_excel()```` |````writexl::write_xlsx()```` |\n|SPSS-files (.sav)        |````haven::read_sav()````    |````haven::write_sav()````    |\n|SAS-files (.sas)         |````haven::read_sas()````    |````haven::write_sas()````    |\n|Stata-files (.stata)     |````haven::read_dta()````    |````haven::write_dta()````    |\n:::\n\n\n## Absolute paths vs. relative paths\n\nYou can head to a specific file by using the full path (**absolute path**): `\"C:\\Users\\hafiznij\\Documents\\GitHub\\r_tutorial\\raw_data\\winners.rda\"`. This approach has some disadvantages: it will only work on **my** notebook. If i want to continue my project on another device, i will have to change the path. The same goes for other people who want to work with my project. So, to keep these paths more reproducable, we should always use **relative paths** if possible: `\".\\raw_data\\winners.rda\"`. This will always work independently of the device i am working on, as long as i am in the correct **working directory**.\n\nThe working directory is the path R is currently working in. I can obtain it by typing:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngetwd()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"C:/Users/hafiznij/Documents/GitHub/r_tutorial/qmd/load_data\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLuckily, as long as we work with RStudio projects, we don't have to deal with that, as the working directory is set automatically by the project.\n\nNow take a look at the working directory and the relative path i used for loading the `winners.rda`. Notice something? Correct, both paths combined equal the **absolute path** to the file. So by splitting it up, we obtain a more reproducible path, that works independent of where the current working directory is.\n\n## The `here` package\n\nAnother great way to deal with the path confusion is to use the `here` package. It can build the paths relative to the directory where your RStudio project is saved in. For example, `\".\\raw_data\\winners.rda\"` becomes `here::here(\"raw_data\", \"winners.rda\")`. This is not increadibly important right now, but I need to mention it because I have to use these path structures sometimes during the tutorial, so don't be confused! It is just another way to build file paths. Look [here](https://here.r-lib.org/) (:D) if you want to learn more about the package.\n",
