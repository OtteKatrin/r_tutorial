I have already tweaked it a bit to make it easier to work with, so just download it from [here](https://github.com/nickhaf/r_tutorial/tree/main/raw_data) and load it into R (write the code for reading in the data into a new script).\n2.  Advanced: Load the `continents.csv` file into R. Did that work as expected? If not, why not? ([Solution](#Solution)) *Hint*: Take a look at the .csv by opening it in a text editor. Look at the documentation of `read.csv()` and take a look at the `sep` argument.\n\n# Solution {#solution}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwinners <- readRDS(file = here::here(\"raw_data\", \"winners.rds\"))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Solution for exercise 1\"}\nwinners <- readRDS(file = \"./raw_data/winners.rds\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Solution for exercise 2\"}\ncontinents <- read.csv(file = \"./raw_data/continents.csv\")\n\nhead(continents)\n \n# Hmm that looks weird. If we take a look at the file by opening it in a text editor, we can see that the values are seperated by `;`. \n# So let's call the help for `read.csv()`:\n\n?read.csv\n\n# The `sep` argument specifies that the seperator needs to be a white space (meaning tabs, spaces ... - look at the details).  \n# So, we can do the following:\n\ncontinents <- read.csv(\n  file = \"./raw_data/continents.csv\",\n  sep = \";\"\n)\n\nhead(continents)\n\n# This looks better! Now we can merge both data sets, so we can actually work with them.\n```\n:::\n",
