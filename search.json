    "text": "Now that we have completed our set up, let’s dive right into programming with R. In this chapter, we will go through a “mini-project”, which follows a typical workflow when working with data in R. We will install and load packages, load data, perform some operations on this data, calculate some summary statistics and plot them. In later chapters, we will go into a little bit more depth for each topic. If you want to have more in depth information instead of following the whole workflow first, you can also jump to the according chapter and read the theory. But make sure to come back to this chapter for the final exercise.\n\n\nPackages are extensions to the base R you get by default. We already installed our first packages in About this workshop. Let’s keep doing that and install the following package as well:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages following a common philosophy, and facilitate many aspects of coding in R, for example data wrangling and plotting. We will use both functions from base R and from the tidyverse.\nJust by installing the packages, we can’t use them. We also have to load them into our R session:\n\nlibrary(tutoR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nThe top of your R Script should look something like this:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"nickhaf/tutoR\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nlibrary(tutoR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nData is loaded into R so you can work with it. Let’s do just that. First, you need to download the file “winners.rds” from this link and save it in your project folder (Tip: Save it in a new subfolder named “raw_data” or somewhat similar.). The data comes from the LondonMarathon package. Next, take a look at the ending. Different data formats need different functions for loading them into R. The winners.rds file has the ending .rds. So we use readRDS to load it into R. Here you can find a more thourough discussion about loading different data formats.\n\nwinners &lt;- readRDS(file = \"./raw_data/winners.rds\")\n\nThis will load the data into R and assigning it the name winners by using the &lt;-. You can see the data popping up in your Environment pane on the upper right. It is important you use the correct path, because otherwise R will not find your data file. Here the RStudio project we have created earlier comes in handy. It automatically knows our file lies within our project folder, which is why we can use a relative path, that starts at the project path and looks into the folder raw_data to open the file. Otherwise, we would have to use an absolute path (like “C:/Users/hafiznij/Documents/GitHub/r_tutorial/raw_data/london_marathon.rda” which will only work on my notebook, and only if my project stays in on this path.\n\n\n\nNow that we have our data loaded safely into R, we can get an overview with a multitude of commands. One of the most important ones might be View(), which will open the data set excel-style in a new window:\n\nView(winners)\n\nEspecially for bigger data sets, it might be more feasible to only look at the structure and not the whole data set:\n\nstr(winners)\n\ntibble [165 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Category   : chr [1:165] \"Men\" \"Men\" \"Men\" \"Men\" ...\n $ Year       : num [1:165] 1981 1981 1982 1983 1984 ...\n $ Athlete    : chr [1:165] \"Dick Beardsley (Tie)\" \"Inge Simonsen (Tie)\" \"Hugh Jones\" \"Mike Gratton\" ...\n $ Nationality: chr [1:165] \"United States\" \"Norway\" \"United Kingdom\" \"United Kingdom\" ...\n $ ID         : int [1:165] 1 NA 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n\n\nOn the left we can see the columns of this data.frame, named Category, Year, Athlete, Nationality and ID. On the right we see the first values in each column, for example 1981, 1981, 1982 etc … in the Year-column.\n\n\n\nNow, lets do something with this data. We want to answer the question if people have gotten faster at running marathons over that last 40 years. Sadly, the finishing times are not saved in this data set, but in another one named times.rda. So we need a way to combine them both, so we can run our analysis on the data.\nExercise: Download the second data set called “times.rda” and load it into R on your own.\n\n\nLet’s take a quick look at that one as well:\n\nstr(times)\n\ntibble [165 × 5] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Time   : 'times' num [1:165] 0.0915 0.0915 0.0899 0.0901 0.0902 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"format\")= chr \"h:m:s\"\n $ Hours  : num [1:165] 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Minutes: num [1:165] 11 11 9 9 9 8 10 9 10 9 ...\n $ Seconds: num [1:165] 48 48 24 43 57 16 2 50 20 3 ...\n $ ID     : int [1:165] 1 NA 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n\n\nThe only column both data sets seem to have in commonn is the ID one. This means we have to merge our two data sets on that column, so rows which have the same value in that column will be merged together. However, we have a slight problem: the ID column contains missing values (called NA). We will not be able to match these rows over both data sets, so we have to remove them. But first, let’s take a look at how many those are:\n\nsum(is.na(times$ID))\n\n[1] 5\n\nsum(is.na(winners$ID))\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nDon’t worry to much about what that code is doing right now, we will take a closer look later on. We seem to have five NAs in both data sets. This isn’t a whole lot, so we will just remove them, but keep in mind dealing with NAs is a broad topic for itself with many different possible approaches.\n\ntimes &lt;- drop_na(data = times, ID)\nwinners &lt;- drop_na(data = winners, ID)\n\nHere, we use a function from the tidyr package (which we installed among others when we installed the tidyverse) that removes all rows from the data that contain a NA in the ID column.\n\n\n\nNow we can merge:\n\nwinners_merged &lt;- merge(x = winners, \n                        y = times,\n                        by = \"ID\")\n\nWhat happens here? We take our two data sets, called winers and times and combine them on the column ID. Let’s take a look at the finished product:\n\nstr(winners_merged)\n\n'data.frame':   160 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ ID         : int  1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 ...\n $ Category   : chr  \"Men\" \"Men\" \"Men\" \"Men\" ...\n $ Year       : num  1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 ...\n $ Athlete    : chr  \"Dick Beardsley (Tie)\" \"Hugh Jones\" \"Mike Gratton\" \"Charlie Spedding\" ...\n $ Nationality: chr  \"United States\" \"United Kingdom\" \"United Kingdom\" \"United Kingdom\" ...\n $ Time       : num  0.0915 0.0899 0.0901 0.0902 0.0891 ...\n $ Hours      : num  2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\n $ Minutes    : num  11 9 9 9 8 10 9 10 9 10 ...\n $ Seconds    : num  48 24 43 57 16 2 50 20 3 10 ...\n\n\nWe have merged the columns of the times data set onto the right the winners data.\n\n\n\nDivide by Category (Wheelchar vs. no wheelchair)\n\n\n\n\nwomen &lt;- winners[winners$Category == \"Women\", ]\n\n\nlm_rs &lt;- lm(Minutes_total ~ Year, women)\nsummary(lm_rs)\n\n# 614 min bei Year = 0, für jedes Jahr -0.23 Min weniger:\n# 614 + 2020 * -0.236\n\n\nplot(lm_rs)\n\n\nwinners$Minutes_total &lt;- winners$Hours * 60 + winners$Minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nwinners %&gt;%\n  filter(Category %in% c(\"Men\", \"Women\")) %&gt;%\nggplot(data = ., aes(x = Year,\n                            y = Minutes_total,\n                     colour = Nationality,\n                     shape = Category)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\nwinners %&gt;%\n  filter(Category %in% c(\"Wheelchair Men\", \"Wheelchair Women\")) %&gt;%\nggplot(data = ., aes(x = Year,\n                            y = Minutes_total,\n                     colour = Nationality,\n                     shape = Category)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Für die Übung. \n#install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2022-08-16')\n\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial we learned, that R is a flexible tool for editing and plotting data. Of course, we barely scratched the surface. Therefore, we want to dive a bit deeper into each step. Either follow the course, or navigate to the chapters you are most interested in."
