It can be run in you browser, and provides the same functions and interface as if you were working with your own RStudio installation. And it’s free as well (at least 25 hours per month, but that should be more than enough for this workshop and propably for the following week).\n\nGo to Posit Cloud.\nClick on GET STARTED.\nCreate an account (it’s free) and login.\nOn the upper right, click on New Project. This will create a new RStudio project, which you can use the same way as described in this tutorial.\n\n\n\nStructure of the RStudio interface\n\nScript Pane\n\n\nConsole\n\n\"Hello World!\"\n\n[1] \"Hello World!\"\n\n\nTadaa, we just wrote our first line of code."

Therefore, we want to write all our code that is worth saving into a script.\n\n\nRStudio Projects\nOver time, it will become increasingly hard to organize all your files, working directories and workspaces in a reasonable manner. For this, RStudio Projects can be used (highly recommended).\n\n\nExercises\n\nCreate a new folder folder for this tutorial, where all your files will go.\nCreate a new RStudio project and open it.\nCreate a new R Script and open it."
