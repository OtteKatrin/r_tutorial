It can be run in you browser, and provides the same functions and interface as if you were working with your own RStudio installation. And it’s free as well (at least 25 hours per month, but that should be more than enough for this workshop and probably for the following week).\n\nGo to posit Cloud.\nClick on GET STARTED.\nCreate an account (it’s free) and login.\nOn the upper right, click on New Project. This will create a new RStudio project, which you can use the same way as described in this tutorial.\n\n\n\nStructure of the RStudio interface\n\nScript Pane\n\n\nConsole\n\n\"Hello World!\"\n\n[1] \"Hello World!\"\n\n\nTadaa, we just wrote our first line of code."

For this, RStudio Projects can be used (highly recommended).\n\n\nExercises\n\nCreate a new folder for this tutorial, where all your files will go.\nCreate a new RStudio project and open it. Got to File - New Project - Existing Directory and select the path of the folder you created in step 1.\nCreate a new R Script by clicking on File - New File - R Script. Save it in you folder.\nTipp: Within your project folder create a folder named R, where all your R Scripts will go. You can do the same for data, plots etc. later on. This will help you to structure your working directory."

    "text": "Now that we have completed our set up, let’s dive right into programming with R. In this chapter, we will go through a “mini-project”, which follows a typical workflow when working with data in R. We will install and load packages, load data, perform some operations on this data, calculate some summary statistics and plot them. In later chapters, we will go into a little bit more depth for each topic. If you want to have more in depth information instead of following the whole workflow first, you can also jump to the according chapter and read the theory. But make sure to come back to this chapter for the final exercise.\n\n\nPackages are extensions to the base R you get by default. We already installed our first packages in About this workshop. Let’s keep doing that and install the following package as well:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nJust by installing the packages, we can’t use them. We also have to load them into our R session:\n\nlibrary(tutoR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nThe top of your R Script should look something like this:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"nickhaf/tutoR\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nlibrary(tutoR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nData is loaded into R so you can work with it. Let’s do just that. First, you need to download the file “london_marathon.csv” from this link and save it in your project folder (Tip: Save it in a new subfolder named “raw_data” or somewhat similar.). The data comes from the LondonMarathon package. Then, you can load it into R:\n\nload(file = \"./raw_data/london_marathon.rda\")\n\nThis will load the data into R. You can see it popping up in your Environment pane on the upper right. Note we used the load() function to load a data set with the ending .rda. Here you can find a more thourough discussion about loading data. It is important you use the correct path, because otherwise R will not find your data file. Here the RStudio project we have created earlier comes in handy. It automatically knows our file lies within our project folder, which is why we can use a relative path, that starts at the project path and looks into the folder raw_data to open the file. Otherwise, we would have to use an absolute path (like “C:/Users/hafiznij/Documents/GitHub/r_tutorial/raw_data/london_marathon.rda” which will only work on my notebook, and only if my project stays in on this path.\n\n\n\nNow that we have our data loaded safely into R, we can get an overview with a multitude of commands. One of the most important ones might be View(), which will open the data set excel-style in a new window:\n\nView(london_marathon)\n\nIf we only want to show the first few rows\nEspecially for bigger data sets, it might be more feasible to only look at the structure and not the whole data set:\n\nstr(london_marathon)\n\ntibble [42 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ Date            : Date[1:42], format: \"1981-03-29\" \"1982-05-09\" ...\n $ Year            : num [1:42] 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 ...\n $ Applicants      : num [1:42] 20000 90000 60000 70000 83000 80000 80000 73000 72000 73000 ...\n $ Accepted        : num [1:42] 7747 18059 19735 21142 22274 ...\n $ Starters        : num [1:42] 7055 16350 16500 16992 17500 ...\n $ Finishers       : num [1:42] 6255 15116 15793 15675 15873 ...\n $ Raised          : num [1:42] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ Official charity: chr [1:42] NA NA NA NA ...\n\n\nOn the left we can see the columns of this data.frame, named Date, Year, Applicants etc … On the right we see the first values in each column, for example 1981, 1982 etc … in the Year-column.\n\n\n\nNow, lets do something with this data. We want to answer the question if people have gotten faster at running marathons over that last 40 years. - Use both data sets.\nWe will use a …\n\n\nSadly, the winners are not saved in this data set, so we have to load that one as well. Exercise: Try to load the second data set called “winners.rda” into R on your own.\nNow that we have two data sets loaded into R, we can merge them by using the merge() command:\n\nmarathon_final &lt;- merge(x = london_marathon, \n                        y = winners,\n                        by = \"Year\",\n                        all = TRUE)\n\nWhat happens here? We take our two data sets, called london_marathon and winners and combine them on the column Year. We don’t want to loose any data that doesn’t have match in the other data set, so we set all = TRUE, and voila:\n\nstr(marathon_final)\n\n'data.frame':   165 obs. of  15 variables:\n $ Year            : num  1981 1981 1981 1982 1982 ...\n $ Date            : Date, format: \"1981-03-29\" \"1981-03-29\" ...\n $ Applicants      : num  20000 20000 20000 90000 90000 60000 60000 60000 60000 70000 ...\n $ Accepted        : num  7747 7747 7747 18059 18059 ...\n $ Starters        : num  7055 7055 7055 16350 16350 ...\n $ Finishers       : num  6255 6255 6255 15116 15116 ...\n $ Raised          : num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ Official charity: chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ Category        : chr  \"Men\" \"Men\" \"Women\" \"Women\" ...\n $ Athlete         : chr  \"Dick Beardsley (Tie)\" \"Inge Simonsen (Tie)\" \"Joyce Smith\" \"Joyce Smith\" ...\n $ Nationality     : chr  \"United States\" \"Norway\" \"United Kingdom\" \"United Kingdom\" ...\n $ Time            : num  0.0915 0.0915 0.1041 0.104 0.0899 ...\n $ Hours           : num  2 2 2 2 2 3 4 2 2 2 ...\n $ Minutes         : num  11 11 29 29 9 20 29 9 25 9 ...\n $ Seconds         : num  48 48 57 43 24 7 3 43 29 57 ...\n\n\nWe have merged the columns of the winner data set onto the right the london_marathon data.\n\n\n\nNo we can tidy up our data a bit.\nRemove NAs, select relevant columns, Build another Time column\n\nwinners$Minutes_total &lt;- winners$Hours * 60 + winners$Minutes\n\n\n\n\nDivide by Category (Wheelchar vs. no wheelchair)\n\n\n\n\nwomen &lt;- winners[winners$Category == \"Women\", ]\n\n\nlm_rs &lt;- lm(Minutes_total ~ Year, women)\nsummary(lm_rs)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Minutes_total ~ Year, data = women)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-7.1827 -1.5880  0.0532  1.7458  7.6944 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

We can compare them somewhat to apps in an appstore:\n1 First, we have to install the package: install.packages(\"packagename\"). - Most of the openly available packages lie on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). But you can also download packages form other sources, for example GitHub. This is what you did when downloading the tutoR package in About this workshop.\n2 Then, we have to load them in each session where we want to use them (like tipping on the app icon): library(packagename).\n\nNote that in install.packages(\"packagename\") we have to put the package into quotation marks, when calling library(packagename) not."
