    "text": "Why R?\n\nR is a popular programming language for data manipulation, statistical data analyses and plotting of data.\nIt is open source, and has a big community, which facilitates the development of additional software packages for multiple different applications, but also makes it easy to get help if you are stuck at a particular problem.\nThis is one of the reasons why R is great for doing statistical analyses - there are packages for almost every use case.\nIt has great tools for making beautiful plots.\nThis is not R specific, but because you can write programs for your specific use cases, it facilitates many workflow related tasks like automation, tracking changes with git, result preparation with markdown/latex and many more.\n\nThere are many more reasons to learn R, as it is a very flexible tool for almost every aspect of scientific work, so let’s dive right into it!"

As you know, our goal is to plot the number of gold medals each country has won. So, we need to calculate how many gold medals each country has won over time. Let’s do that quickly, using some tidyverse functions. It is not especially important you understand and know everything that happens here, but we need it for the next chapters, so here it goes:\n\n\nmedal_counts &lt;- athletes %&gt;%\n  filter(Medal == \"Gold\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(Region) %&gt;%\n  count(Medal) \n\nmedal_counts\n\n# A tibble: 99 × 3\n# Groups:   Region [99]\n   Region     Medal     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Algeria    Gold      5\n 2 Argentina  Gold     91\n 3 Armenia    Gold      2\n 4 Australia  Gold    368\n 5 Austria    Gold    108\n 6 Azerbaijan Gold      7\n 7 Bahamas    Gold     14\n 8 Bahrain    Gold      1\n 9 Belarus    Gold     24\n10 Belgium    Gold     98\n# ℹ 89 more rows\n\n\n\nWhat happens here?

    "section": "Merging",
    "text": "Merging\nTo merge two data frames that include information that belongs together, we need a common column, on which we can combine them. In our case, this is the column containing the country. They are both named region, but one with an upper case R. This doesn’t pose a problem, as we can define which columns should be taken from which data frame for merging. Let’s take a quick look before to see if there are any countries named differently in both data sets (this simply combines commands we have already looked at in the Basic operations chapter:\n\nmedal_counts$Region[!(medal_counts$Region %in% world_coordinates$region)]\n\n[1] \"Individual Olympic Athletes\"\n\n\nLooks like all of the countries in our medal_countries data frame can be also found in our world_coordinates frame. Only athletes without a country will be lost when merging, but that’s ok for now, as we are interested in the country specific gold medal counts. So let’s merge:\n\nmedal_countries &lt;- merge(\n  x = medal_counts,\n  y = world_coordinates,\n  by.x = \"Region\",\n  by.y = \"region\",\n  all.x = FALSE,\n  all.y = TRUE\n)\n\nhead(medal_countries)\n\n       Region Medal  n     long      lat group order subregion\n1 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.89131 37.23164     2    12      &lt;NA&gt;\n2 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.84023 37.22505     2    13      &lt;NA&gt;\n3 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.76738 37.24917     2    14      &lt;NA&gt;\n4 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.73896 37.28564     2    15      &lt;NA&gt;\n5 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.72666 37.29072     2    16      &lt;NA&gt;\n6 Afghanistan  &lt;NA&gt; NA 74.66895 37.26670     2    17      &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nNote that we also used the all.x and all.y arguments. In this example, we want to take all rows from the second data set, but only those from the first data set, that have a match in the second data set. This is necessary, because we want to plot all countries later on, but only those we have coordinates for, because they won’t show up on the map otherwise.\nUsing the tidyverse, we first have to rename our region column, as the column names need to be the same over both data sets that are merged. left_join() means that we will merge onto the first data set (world_coordinates in the code below), like we have done using the all.x and all.y arguments in the merge() function.\n\n\nmedal_countries &lt;- world_coordinates %&gt;%\n  rename(\"Region\" = region) %&gt;%\n  left_join(medal_counts)\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(Region)`\n\nhead(medal_countries)\n\n       long      lat group order Region subregion Medal  n\n1 -69.89912 12.45200     1     1  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n2 -69.89571 12.42300     1     2  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n3 -69.94219 12.43853     1     3  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n4 -70.00415 12.50049     1     4  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n5 -70.06612 12.54697     1     5  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n6 -70.05088 12.59707     1     6  Aruba      &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt; NA\n\n\n\nGreat!

    "text": "There are five main data structures in R which differ on their dimensions (one dimension, two dimensions, n dimensions) and the type of the elements they are containing (same type, different types):1\n\n\n\n\n\nHomogeneous\nHeterogeneous\n\n\n\n\n1d\natomic vector\nlist\n\n\n2d\nmatrix\ndata.frame\n\n\nnd\narray\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the two we will use mostly throughout this workshop:\n\n\nAtomic vectors (from hereon only called vectors) contain elements of only the same type:\n\nnum_vec &lt;- c(2023, 8, 8)\nnum_vec\n\n[1] 2023    8    8\n\nchar_vec &lt;- c(\"This\", \"is\", \"a\", \"vec\", \".\")\nchar_vec\n\n[1] \"This\" \"is\"   \"a\"    \"vec\"  \".\"   \n\nlog_vec &lt;- c(TRUE, FALSE)\nlog_vec\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE\n\n\nThe c() stands for combine, or concatenate, and is the basic function for building a vector out of single elements.\n\n\nIf we take a look at the structure of the vectors we have just created, we see se a short description of the data type we are dealing with in front of the vector:\n\nstr(num_vec)\n\n num [1:3] 2023 8 8\n\nstr(char_vec)\n\n chr [1:5] \"This\" \"is\" \"a\" \"vec\" \".\"\n\nstr(log_vec)\n\n logi [1:2] TRUE FALSE\n\n\nThe first one is num (numeric) so it only stores numeric values. The second one is char (character), so it only can contain strings. And last but not least we have logi (logical) for boolean values. Why is that important? Well, some functions only make sense for specific data types. For example:\n\nmean(char_vec)\n\nWarning in mean.default(char_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:\nreturning NA\n\n\n[1] NA\n\n\ngives us a warning, because the input has the wrong format.\n\n\n\n\nA data frame is two dimensional and can store elements of different types. It is the closest to data tables we are probably most used to working with.\n\npersons &lt;- data.frame(name = c(\"Anna\", \"Alex\", \"John\", \"Jessi\"),\n                      age = c(19, 17, 18, 18),\n                      birth_month = c(\"Jan\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Mar\"),\n                      big5_extro = c(3.5, 2, 4.5, 4.2)\n                      )\n\nNote that we do nothing else here than combining vectors to a data frame. Each vector will be one column.\n\n\nAdding new columns to a data frame is pretty straight forward. We just define the column name, and then assign it some input. For example, we could add a column with the neuroticsm ratings for each person:\n\npersons$big5_neuro &lt;- c(1, 3, 2, 4)\npersons\n\n   name age birth_month big5_extro big5_neuro\n1  Anna  19         Jan        3.5          1\n2  Alex  17         Sep        2.0          3\n3  John  18         Oct        4.5          2\n4 Jessi  18         Mar        4.2          4\n\n\nOr, using the tidyverse with the help of mutate():\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\npersons &lt;- mutate(persons, big5_agree= c(2, 5, 2, 1) )\n\n\n\n\n\nA special type of data frames are the so called tibbles. Tibbles are a modern version of data frames and the standard data frame type of the tidyverse, as they have some advantageous characteristics (e.g., note the more informative printing of the data frame). So don’t be confused if you run into them, in general they behave like data frames.\n\n\npersons_tibble &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  name = c(\"Anna\", \"Alex\", \"John\", \"Jessi\"),\n  age = c(19, 17, 18, 18),\n  birth_month = c(\"Jan\", \"Sep\", \"Oct\", \"Mar\"),\n  big5_extro = c(3.5, 2, 4.5, 4.2)\n)\npersons_tibble\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  name    age birth_month big5_extro\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Anna     19 Jan                3.5\n2 Alex     17 Sep                2  \n3 John     18 Oct                4.5\n4 Jessi    18 Mar                4.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA list is a one dimensional object, which can, unlike a vector, contain elements of different types, but also of different lengths. For example, we can store a vectors of different lengths and data frames in a list, which makes it the most versatile data structure:\n\npersonality_rating &lt;- list(\n     big5 = data.frame(name = c(\"Jessi\", \"John\"),\n                       extraversion = c(4.3, 2), \n                       openness = c(3.8, NA)),\n     rating_type = \"self_rating\"\n     )\npersonality_rating\n\n$big5\n   name extraversion openness\n1 Jessi          4.3      3.8\n2  John          2.0       NA\n\n$rating_type\n[1] \"self_rating\"\n\n\nHere, we define the list personality_rating, which includes a data frame with the personality rating, and some meta information in the form of a character vector, describing the rating type. We won’t use it any more in this workshop, but keep in mind it exists, as it quickly becomes necessary for managing more complex tasks."

If not, why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at the .csv file by opening it in a text editor. Look at the documentation of read.csv() and take a look at the sep argument. Can you define another separator, so R can deduce, which elements need to be separated into different cells?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try the read.csv() function:\n\npsych_stats &lt;- read.csv(file = here::here(\"raw_data\", \"psych_stats.csv\"))\n\nhead(psych_stats)\n\n    char_id.question.mean_rating.rating_sd.number_ratings\n1                          1;F2;messy/neat;95.7;11.7;1079\n2       2;F2;disorganized/self-disciplined;95.2;11.2;1185\n3           3;F2;diligent/lazy;6.09999999999999;10.4;1166\n4                         4;F2;on-time/tardy;6.2;14.3;236\n5 5;F2;competitive/cooperative;6.40000000000001;13.4;1168\n6   6;F2;scheduled/spontaneous;6.59999999999999;14.5;1173\n\n\nHuh, that looks weird. If we take a look at the file by opening it in a text editor, we can see that the values are seperated by ;. So let’s call the help for read.csv():\n\n?read.csv\n\nThe sep argument specifies that the seperator needs to be a white space (meaning tabs, spaces … - look at the details in the documentation).\nSo, we can do the following:\n\npsych_stats &lt;- read.csv(\n  file = here::here(\"raw_data\", \"psych_stats.csv\"),\n  sep = \";\"\n)\n\nhead(psych_stats)\n\n  char_id                      question mean_rating rating_sd number_ratings\n1      F2                    messy/neat        95.7      11.7           1079\n2      F2 disorganized/self-disciplined        95.2      11.2           1185\n3      F2                 diligent/lazy         6.1      10.4           1166\n4      F2                 on-time/tardy         6.2      14.3            236\n5      F2       competitive/cooperative         6.4      13.4           1168\n6      F2         scheduled/spontaneous         6.6      14.5           1173\n\n\nThis looks better!"

    "title": "Missing values",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Remember the weird NA rows we encountered when subsetting by condition? We were able to steer around that by using filter(), but let’s take a closer look at that now.\nMissing values are denoted in R by NA (or NaN in some cases). They nullify a calculation or comparison pretty strongly - if one missing value is found somewhere along the line, the result will also be NA (if not specified otherwise):\n\nc(4, NA) &gt; 3\n\n[1] TRUE   NA\n\n\nThat’s why we got some NA rows when trying to extract specific rows by weight: these rows had an NA in the weight column, and R returned rows with NA's as a result.\nTo check if values are NA, we can use is.na():\n\nis.na(athletes$Weight)\n\n    [1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n   [13] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n   [25] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n   [37] FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n...\n\n\nSome TRUEs, so there are missing values here. Let’s count them (Summing a logical vector counts the number of TRUE values.):\n\nsum(is.na(athletes$Weight))\n\n[1] 62785\n\n\nWe seem to have 62785 missings in this column.\nThere are multiple different ways to deal with missings. For our comparison problem, we can add the new condition that all rows selected shouldn’t have an NA in the Weight column:\n\nathletes[(athletes$Sport == \"Judo\") & (athletes$Weight &gt; 100 | athletes$Weight &lt; 50) & !is.na(athletes$Weight), ]\n\n       NOC     ID                                 Name Sex Age Height Weight\n471    ALG  13895                  Mohamed Bouaichaoui   M  25    178  120.0\n673    ALG  82643                        Meriem Moussa   F  20    150   48.0\n702    ALG  80035                      Boualem Miloudi   M  23    192  106.0\n...\n\n\nWhat happens here? Like always when filtering specific rows, we define a logical vector, which has a TRUE for all rows that have a missing on ID and a FALSE for all others (by using the ! operator, which inverts the boolean values - otherwise we would extract all rows with missing values in the Weight column):\n\n!is.na(athletes$Weight)\n\n    [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n   [13]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n   [25]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n   [37]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n...\n\n\nWe also assign the new name athletes_na to the resulting data frame, so we don’t overwrite the original one.\nRemoving NA's from a data frame works pretty similar:\n\nathletes_na &lt;- athletes[!is.na(athletes$Weight), ]\nhead(athletes_na)\n\n   NOC     ID                 Name Sex Age Height Weight        Team\n3  AFG  44977    Mohammad Halilula   M  28    163     57 Afghanistan\n5  AFG 109153   Shakar Khan Shakar   M  24     NA     74 Afghanistan\n6  AFG  29626 Sultan Mohammad Dost   M  28    168     73 Afghanistan\n9  AFG  80210             Alam Mir   M  NA     NA     57 Afghanistan\n11 AFG 116125 Nizam-ud-din Subhani   M  34    168    111 Afghanistan\n13 AFG 133692    Khojawahid Zahedi   M  20    178     74 Afghanistan\n         Games Year Season   City     Sport\n3  1980 Summer 1980 Summer Moskva Wrestling\n5  1964 Summer 1964 Summer  Tokyo Wrestling\n6  1960 Summer 1960 Summer   Roma Wrestling\n9  1972 Summer 1972 Summer Munich Wrestling\n11 1960 Summer 1960 Summer   Roma Wrestling\n13 1980 Summer 1980 Summer Moskva Wrestling\n                                       Event Medal      Region\n3    Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n5    Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n6    Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n9  Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Greco-Roman  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n11    Wrestling Men's Heavyweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n13   Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Afghanistan\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nathletes_na &lt;- athletes %&gt;%\n  drop_na(Weight)\nhead(athletes_na)\n\n  NOC     ID                 Name Sex Age Height Weight        Team       Games\n1 AFG  44977    Mohammad Halilula   M  28    163     57 Afghanistan 1980 Summer\n2 AFG 109153   Shakar Khan Shakar   M  24     NA     74 Afghanistan 1964 Summer\n3 AFG  29626 Sultan Mohammad Dost   M  28    168     73 Afghanistan 1960 Summer\n4 AFG  80210             Alam Mir   M  NA     NA     57 Afghanistan 1972 Summer\n5 AFG 116125 Nizam-ud-din Subhani   M  34    168    111 Afghanistan 1960 Summer\n6 AFG 133692    Khojawahid Zahedi   M  20    178     74 Afghanistan 1980 Summer\n  Year Season   City     Sport                                     Event Medal\n1 1980 Summer Moskva Wrestling   Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n2 1964 Summer  Tokyo Wrestling   Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n3 1960 Summer   Roma Wrestling   Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n4 1972 Summer Munich Wrestling Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Greco-Roman  &lt;NA&gt;\n5 1960 Summer   Roma Wrestling    Wrestling Men's Heavyweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n6 1980 Summer Moskva Wrestling   Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt;\n       Region\n1 Afghanistan\n2 Afghanistan\n3 Afghanistan\n4 Afghanistan\n5 Afghanistan\n6 Afghanistan\n\n\n\nBoth code versions will remove all rows containing NAs in the weight column.\nAs already stated, it is not always necessary to remove NAs manually from the data set.

This way, your code will still work if the column position changes.\n\n\n\n\nRows & Columns\nAnd of course we can combine both calls:\n\nathletes[c(1, 4), c(2, 4)]\n\n      ID Sex\n1 132181   M\n4    502   M\n\nathletes[c(1, 4), c(\"Year\", \"Sport\")]\n\n  Year  Sport\n1 1956 Hockey\n4 1956 Hockey\n\n\nWe can also use Boolean values (every row/column must get a value here, so we extract the first 100 rows by repeating TRUE 100 times, and than add FALSE for the remaining rows):\n\nstr(athletes[c(rep(TRUE, 100), rep(FALSE, 271016)), ])\n\n'data.frame':   100 obs. of  16 variables:\n $ NOC   : chr  \"AFG\" \"AFG\" \"AFG\" \"AFG\" ...\n $ ID    : int  132181 87371 44977 502 109153 29626 1076 121376 80210 87374 ...\n $ Name  : chr  \"Najam Yahya\" \"Ahmad Jahan Nuristani\" \"Mohammad Halilula\" \"Ahmad Shah Abouwi\" ...\n $ Sex   : chr  \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" \"M\" ...\n $ Age   : int  NA NA 28 NA 24 28 28 NA NA NA ...\n $ Height: int  NA NA 163 NA NA 168 NA NA NA NA ...\n $ Weight: num  NA NA 57 NA 74 73 NA NA 57 NA ...\n $ Team  : chr  \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" ...\n $ Games : chr  \"1956 Summer\" \"1948 Summer\" \"1980 Summer\" \"1956 Summer\" ...\n $ Year  : int  1956 1948 1980 1956 1964 1960 1936 1956 1972 1956 ...\n $ Season: chr  \"Summer\" \"Summer\" \"Summer\" \"Summer\" ...\n $ City  : chr  \"Melbourne\" \"London\" \"Moskva\" \"Melbourne\" ...\n $ Sport : chr  \"Hockey\" \"Hockey\" \"Wrestling\" \"Hockey\" ...\n $ Event : chr  \"Hockey Men's Hockey\" \"Hockey Men's Hockey\" \"Wrestling Men's Bantamweight, Freestyle\" \"Hockey Men's Hockey\" ...\n $ Medal : chr  NA NA NA NA ...\n $ Region: chr  \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" \"Afghanistan\" ...\n\n\n\n\nConditional filtering\nNow the stuff we looked at in logical operators comes in handy! We can filter rows which match some condition. For example, we might want to look at all athletes from Germany:\n\nathletes[athletes$Team == \"Germany\", ]\n\n       NOC     ID\n107246 GER   7385\n107247 GER 114424\n107248 GER 112937\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfold if you want to take a closer look at what is happening here\n\n\n\n\n\nTake a close look at the comparison before the ,:\n\nathletes$Team == \"Germany\"\n\n    [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n   [13] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n   [25] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n   [37] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\n...\n\n\nathletes$Team is a vector, so comparing its values to a specified value yields a logical vector with the respective TRUE and FALSE values. We can insert this logical vector in front of the , to extract all rows corresponding to that condition.\n\n\n\nIf we want to extract multiple nationalities at once, we need the %in% operator:\n\nathletes[athletes$Team %in% c(\"Kenya\", \"Norway\"), ]\n\n       NOC     ID                                                          Name\n156375 KEN  60617                                               Nixon Kiprotich\n156376 KEN  85669                                             Benjamin Ngaruiya\n156377 KEN  60620                                    Wilson Arap Chuma Kiprugut\n...\n\n\nBy the way, if we want to save our extracted data frame, we can assign it a new name (otherwise it will only get printed into the console, but we can’t go on working with it):\n\nathletes_team &lt;- athletes[athletes$Team %in% c(\"Kenya\", \"Norway\"), ]\nathletes_team\n\n       NOC     ID                                                          Name\n156375 KEN  60617                                               Nixon Kiprotich\n156376 KEN  85669                                             Benjamin Ngaruiya\n156377 KEN  60620                                    Wilson Arap Chuma Kiprugut\n...\n\n\nWe can also combine multiple logical vectors using & (“and”) and | (“or”). For example, we might want to look at all german athletes before the year 2000:\n\nathletes_2 &lt;- athletes[athletes$Team == \"Germany\" & athletes$Year &lt; 2000, ]\nhead(athletes_2)\n\n       NOC     ID                   Name Sex Age Height Weight    Team\n107246 GER   7385     Dirk Peter Balster   M  26    195     90 Germany\n107247 GER 114424 Kathleen Stark (-Kern)   F  16    166     51 Germany\n107250 GER   9399     Petra Behle-Schaaf   F  23    177     67 Germany\n107252 GER   9398 Jochen Friedrich Behle   M  37    183     73 Germany\n107253 GER  47318          Martin Heinze   M  21    172     73 Germany\n107254 GER  96348        Ramona Portwich   F  25    175     70 Germany\n             Games Year Season        City                Sport\n107246 1992 Summer 1992 Summer   Barcelona               Rowing\n107247 1992 Summer 1992 Summer   Barcelona           Gymnastics\n107250 1992 Winter 1992 Winter Albertville             Biathlon\n107252 1998 Winter 1998 Winter      Nagano Cross Country Skiing\n107253 1960 Summer 1960 Summer        Roma            Wrestling\n107254 1992 Summer 1992 Summer   Barcelona             Canoeing\n                                            Event Medal  Region\n107246                 Rowing Men's Coxless Fours  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107247             Gymnastics Women's Uneven Bars  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107250     Biathlon Women's 7.5 kilometres Sprint  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107252   Cross Country Skiing Men's 10 kilometres  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107253    Wrestling Men's Welterweight, Freestyle  &lt;NA&gt; Germany\n107254 Canoeing Women's Kayak Doubles, 500 metres  Gold Germany\n\n\nOr at all judo athletes weighting over 100 or under 50 kg:\n\nathletes_3 &lt;- athletes[(athletes$Sport == \"Judo\") & (athletes$Weight &gt; 100 | athletes$Weight &lt; 50) , ]\nhead(athletes_3)\n\n      NOC    ID                Name  Sex Age Height Weight    Team       Games\nNA   &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.1 &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.2 &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.3 &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\n471   ALG 13895 Mohamed Bouaichaoui    M  25    178    120 Algeria 2004 Summer\nNA.4 &lt;NA&gt;    NA                &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt;  NA     NA     NA    &lt;NA&gt;        &lt;NA&gt;\n     Year Season   City Sport                  Event Medal  Region\nNA     NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.1   NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.2   NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\nNA.3   NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\n471  2004 Summer Athina  Judo Judo Men's Heavyweight  &lt;NA&gt; Algeria\nNA.4   NA   &lt;NA&gt;   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;                   &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nHmm, that looks a bit weird. Some rows only contain NA values. That’s because there are missing values in the Weight column. We will look at that closer in the missings chapter and ignore that problem for now.\nIn the long run, always having to specify the name of the data frame for each column or row with condition can become a bit annoying and clutters the code. Also this code leaves all rows with missing values…\nInstead, we can use the filter() function from the tidyverse:\n\nRows: Tidyverse\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nathletes %&gt;% \n  filter(Sport == \"Judo\", (Weight &gt; 100 | Weight &lt; 50))\n\n    NOC     ID                                 Name Sex Age Height Weight\n1   ALG  13895                  Mohamed Bouaichaoui   M  25    178  120.0\n2   ALG  82643                        Meriem Moussa   F  20    150   48.0\n3   ALG  80035                      Boualem Miloudi   M  23    192  106.0\n...\n\n\n\nNote how we can just write our conditions without connecting them with & (filter() does that automatically for us). Also, we don’t have to put the column names into \"\", because filter() knows that this are column names of the athletes data frame, which makes coding a bit more pleasant. And finally, missing rows are automatically removed, which makes sense in many cases!\n\n\nColumns: Tidyverse\nFor extracting columns, we need select():\n\n\nathletes %&gt;%\n  select(Year, Sport)\n\n      Year                     Sport\n1     1956                    Hockey\n2     1948                    Hockey\n3     1980                 Wrestling\n..."

    "text": "Vectors\nFinally, let’s take a quick look at how to extract elements from a vector, which shouldn’t be a problem after already dealing with data frames. It’s pretty straight forward: we just put the position of the element we want to extract behind the vector in square brackets (without a ,, as we only have a one dimensional object). Let’s quickly define a vector for illustration:\n\nvec_sport &lt;- athletes$Sport # remember: `$` returns a vector\n\nAnd look at the second element:\n\nvec_sport[2]\n\n[1] \"Hockey\"\n\n\nOf course we can also do that for multiple elements:\n\nvec_sport[c(2, 3, 4)]\n\n[1] \"Hockey\"    \"Wrestling\" \"Hockey\"   \n\n## Or, less to write:\nvec_sport[2:4]\n\n[1] \"Hockey\"    \"Wrestling\" \"Hockey\"   \n\n\nAnother way would be to provide a logical vector, which defines for each position if we want to extract the element or not (like we already did for data frames):\n\nvec_sport[c(rep(TRUE, 100), rep(FALSE, 65))]\n\n    [1] \"Hockey\"                    \"Hockey\"                   \n    [3] \"Wrestling\"                 \"Hockey\"                   \n    [5] \"Wrestling\"                 \"Wrestling\"                \n    [7] \"Hockey\"                    \"Hockey\"                   \n..."

    "text": "For-loops\n\nMotivation\nWhen programming, you often want to repeat an operation multiple times. For example, assume you want to print the number of gold medals for each country into your console. The most intuitive way would be to just copy paste the code with changed country names:\n\nprint(\n  paste0(\n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Algeria\", \"n\"], \n    \" Olympic gold medalists are from \", \n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Algeria\", \"Region\"], \n    \".\")\n  )\n\n[1] \"5 Olympic gold medalists are from Algeria.\"\n\nprint(\n  paste0(\n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Argentina\", \"n\"], \n    \" Olympic gold medalists are from \", \n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Argentina\", \"Region\"], \n    \".\")\n  )\n\n[1] \"91 Olympic gold medalists are from Argentina.\"\n\nprint(\n  paste0(\n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Armenia\", \"n\"], \n    \" Olympic gold medalists are from \", \n    medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Armenia\", \"Region\"], \n    \".\")\n  )\n\n[1] \"2 Olympic gold medalists are from Armenia.\"\n\nprint(\n  paste0(medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Australia\", \"n\"], \n         \" Olympic gold medalists are from \", \n         medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == \"Australia\", \"Region\"],\n         \".\")\n  )\n\n[1] \"368 Olympic gold medalists are from Australia.\"\n\n\nThis could go on …\nHere we paste together a sentence consisting of data and some pre specified character strings, which we then print into the console. However, this can become pretty tedious if we want to add more countries, and what if we want to change something in the print statement? In this case, we would have to go over all rows and change it multiple times. So, let’s write a loop that does that automatically for us:\n\nfor(i in unique(medal_counts$Region)){\n  print(\n    paste0(\n      medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == i, \"n\"], \n      \" Olympic

Also, if we want to change something, we only have to change it once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn general, try not to repeat yourself when writing code. As a general rule of thumb, use loops and/or functions if you need to copy/paste something more than two times.\n\n\n\n\nHow to write a for-loop?\nLet’s take a step back and look at what we are actually doing here. A for loop is generally constructed like this:\nfor(counter in values){\n  repeat something with changing counter\n}\nWhat does that mean? Let’s look at a simple example first. We want to multiply the values from 10 to 20 with 100 and then print them into our console:\n\nfor(i in 10:20){\n  new_i &lt;- i * 100\n  print(new_i)\n}\n\n[1] 1000\n[1] 1100\n[1] 1200\n[1] 1300\n[1] 1400\n[1] 1500\n[1] 1600\n[1] 1700\n[1] 1800\n[1] 1900\n[1] 2000\n\n\n\nIn the first iteration, i takes the value of the first vector element behind in, which is 10.\nThe operation in the loop body gets executed, in this case the current value gets multiplied by 100 and then printed into the console.\nAfter the operation is finished, i takes the next value, in this case 11, and the whole process starts again.\nThe loop is finished after the operation on the last value has been executed, in this case 20.\n\nLet’s get back to our initial example. Try to figure out what happens here by yourself. What is the first and the last value i gets assigned?\n\nfor(i in unique(medal_counts$Region)){\n  print(\n    paste0(\n      medal_counts[medal_counts$Region == i, \"n\"], \n      \" Olympic gold medalists are from \", \n      i, \n      \".\" )\n    )\n}\n\n[1] \"5 Olympic gold medalists are from Algeria.\"\n[1] \"91 Olympic gold medalists are from Argentina.\"\n[1] \"2 Olympic gold medalists are from Armenia.\"\n[1] \"368 Olympic gold medalists are from Australia.\"\n[1] \"108 Olympic gold medalists are from Austria.\"\n[1] \"7 Olympic gold medalists are from Azerbaijan.\"\n[1] \"14

100){\n  x * 2\n}else{\n  x\n}\n\n[1] 20\n\n\nInside the if() we define our condition. Then, inside the { } we define an operation that gets executed, if this condition is met. Inside the else{ } part we define an operation that gets executed if the condition in if() is not met.\nIn our inital example we check if the number of gold medalists is equal to one. If that is the case, we print the specific statement. If not, we print the other.\n\n\nifelse()\nWe can use this concept for adding new values conditionally to a data frame. For example, let’s build a dichotomous variable to check which countries have equal to or more than 100 gold medal winners:\nNote that the look of this ifelse() function is a bit different from our if else statement, but the logic behind it is exactly the same: Here we add the new column n_100 which gets filled with TRUE and FALSE. If the statement medal_counts$n &gt;= 100, which is the first argument of the ifelse() function, is met, the function returns a TRUE, if not a FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that in general it is good practice to try to avoid using for loops and use functions from the apply-family instead, as for-loops allow you to write horrible code. Still, sometimes for-loops are the better option, depending on the use case. Also, their structure is pretty much the same over many programming languages."

We already had a quick glimpse at it: Plots are build from different layers to create complex outputs. There are endless possibilities for different plot types, look at the R graph gallery for some inspiration and code.\nFirst, let’s plot a relatively simple plot to get you familiar with how ggplot2 works. After that, we will use the preparation we have done in the last chapters to plot the number of gold medals each country has won over the years on a world map, which gets slightly more complex.\nLet’s load our data (if you haven’t already):\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nathletes &lt;- readRDS(file = here::here(\"raw_data\", \"athletes.rds\"))"

    "text": "First plot\nFor this plot, we want to find the country with the most medal winners for each sport. The preparation is pretty similar to what we have done before.\n\n\nbest_by_sport &lt;- athletes %&gt;%\n  ## Get all gold medalists\n  filter(Medal == \"Gold\") %&gt;%\n  ## Group them by sport and region\n  group_by(Sport, Region) %&gt;%\n  ## count the number of medals each country has per sport category\n  count(Medal) %&gt;%\n  ## Now only group by sport, so we can extract the maximum medal row by sport, and not by sport and country\n  group_by(Sport) %&gt;%\n  ## Extract the country with the most medals\n  slice(which.max(n)) \n\n\nggplot()\nIn general, a ggplot starts with the ggplot() function. In it we define the data we want to use, and some aesthetics. The ggplot() function then draws our (currently still empty) plotting area, with the defined axes (see next section).\n\n\naes()\nAesthetics set parameters dependent on the data. In most cases, we will define our x and y axis here. We can also group data together by groups found in a column. If we want the data to have a different color, form, filling etc. depending on values in a column, we can define that here as well (we will look at that later on).\n\np &lt;- ggplot(\n  data = best_by_sport,\n  aes(\n    x = Sport,\n    y = n,\n  )\n)\n\np\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the sport is plotted on the x axis and the number of gold medals (n) on the y axis. Bar filling will vary depending on the region.\n\n\ngeom_()\nThe geoms do the actual plotting. For example, if we want a barplot:\n\np +\n  geom_col()\n\n\n\n\nLooking pretty boring, right? Let’s give each country another color by defining the fill aesthetic. Also, lets order the x axis depending on the number of gold medalists:\n\np &lt;- p +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = Region, x = reorder(Sport, n)))\np\n\n\n\n\nCorrect! We can define the aesthetics also within the geom_() functions. In this case they will only be used for that specific function, and not for the whole plot (which would be the case if we had defined the fill aesthetic in the ggplot() function).\n\np +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThis gives us black points now. If we had defined our aesthetics in the ggplot() function, the points would have the same colors as the bars. Also note that we layed another geom (geom_point()) over our plot, we added a new layer (that’s what I meant earlier on by saying plots consist of different layers).\n\n\nGeneral plotting options\nWe can tweak all aspects of the appearance of a plot. For example, we might want to turn the x axis labels by 90 degrees to actually make them readable:\n\np &lt;- p +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\np\n\n\n\n\nOr we could label the bars with the country:\n\np &lt;- p +\n  geom_text(aes(label = Region), hjust = -0.3, angle = 90, size = 2.5)\np\n\n\n\n\nOr use different colors and a different theme:\n\np &lt;- p +\n  theme_classic() +\n  ## And turn the axis labels again, because the new theme has overwritten our theme\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +\n  ## Specify which colors are used for the filling\n  scale_fill_manual(values = viridisLite::viridis(19))\n\np  \n\n\n\n\nFinally, change the title and axis labels:\n\np +\n  ggtitle(\"Country with the most Olympic gold medal winners by sport\") +\n  xlab(\"Sport\") +\n  ylab(\"Number of gold medal winners\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty cool! Now we know that the UK is the all time Olympic Tug-Of-War champion! Also note that we are looking at the number of people from each country winning a gold medal, so team sports are counted multiple times."

This approach has some disadvantages: it will only work on my notebook. If I want to continue my project on another device, I will have to change the path. The same goes for other people who want to work with my project. So, to keep these paths more reproducable, we should always use relative paths: \".\\raw_data\\winners.rda\". This will always work independently of the device I am working on, as long as I am in the correct working directory.\nThe working directory is the path R is currently working in. I can obtain it by typing:\n\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/home/runner/work/r_tutorial/r_tutorial/qmd/load_data\"\n\n\nLuckily, we have already created a RStudio projects, which sets the working directory automatically, so we don’t really have to deal with that.\nNow take a look at the working directory and the relative path I used for loading the winners.rda. Notice something? Correct, both paths combined equal the absolute path to the file. So by splitting it up, we obtain a more reproducible path, that works independent of where the current working directory is."

    "text": "How to write a function?\nEverything that does something in R is a function. We have already used a lot of them, like print(), filter(), merge(). The great thing is: we can define our own functions pretty easily:\nfunction_name &lt;- function(argument_1, argument_2, ...){\n  do some operations\n  \n  return(result)\n}\nWe always have to give the function a concise name (often not that easy). Then we specify some arguments (which should also have concise names), which can be changed by the user. In our introductory example that was just the athlete name. Inside the { } we define the operations, which can use the arguments so the users can specify some parts of the functions behavior. In the end, it is good practice to return the result by using return(), so it is always clear what the function is giving back to the user. One minimal example with three arguments would be to sum three numbers. We can also provide a default option for the arguments, which the function will fall back on, if the user doesn’t specify anything:\n\nsum_num &lt;- function(x, y, z = 0){\n  result &lt;- x + y + z\n  return(result)\n}\n\nsum_num(x = 1, y = 1, z = 2)\n\n[1] 4\n\n## We don't have to use the arguments in order, IF we name them:\nsum_num(y = 2, z = 4, x = 1)\n\n[1] 7\n\n## We don't have to specify z, because the function can use a default:\nsum_num(x = 3, y = 1)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIt often makes sense to explicitly write the argument names into your function call. This makes your code clearer, and avoid a mix up."

When working with R you will have to rely heavily on packages developed by others. There are many, many great packages out there facilitating your work with R and making possible many different analyses, visualizations and many more.\nWe can compare them somewhat to apps in an appstore:\n2 First, we have to install the package: install.packages(\"packagename\"). Most of the openly available packages lie on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). But you can also download packages form other sources, for example GitHub. This is what you did when downloading the tutoR package in About this workshop.\n3 Then, we have to load them in each session where we want to use them (like tapping on the app icon): library(packagename)."

Therefore, it is good practice to save the R version and package versions, so your code stays (kind of) reproducable for a longer period of time.

Look at the documentation of ?merge to see, how you can merge data frames that don’t have identically named columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, let`s take a look at both data sets again:\n\nstr(characters)\n\n'data.frame':   889 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ id        : chr  \"F2\" \"F1\" \"F5\" \"F4\" ...\n $ name      : chr  \"Monica Geller\" \"Rachel Green\" \"Chandler Bing\" \"Joey Tribbiani\" ...\n $ uni_id    : chr  \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" ...\n $ uni_name  : chr  \"Friends\" \"Friends\" \"Friends\" \"Friends\" ...\n $ notability: num  79.7 76.7 74.4 74.3 72.6 51.6 86.5 84.2 82.6 65.6 ...\n $ link      : chr  \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/F/2\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/F/1\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/F/5\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/stats/F/4\" ...\n $ image_link: chr  \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/F/2.jpg\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/F/1.jpg\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/F/5.jpg\" \"https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/characters/test-resources/pics/F/4.jpg\" ...\n\nstr(psych_stats)\n\n'data.frame':   356489 obs. of  5 variables:\n $ char_id       : chr  \"F2\" \"F2\" \"F2\" \"F2\" ...\n $ question      : chr  \"messy/neat\" \"disorganized/self-disciplined\" \"diligent/lazy\" \"on-time/tardy\" ...\n $ mean_rating   : num  95.7 95.2 6.1 6.2 6.4 ...\n $ rating_sd     : num  11.7 11.2 10.4 14.3 13.4 14.5 15 17.3 12.1 11.1 ...\n $ number_ratings: int  1079 1185 1166 236 1168 1173 174 1196 129 1183 ...\n\n\nIt seems like both data frames have a column containing an ID for the character.

    "text": "Now that we have completed our set up, let’s dive right into programming with R. In this chapter, we will go through a “mini-project” with very basic data, which follows a possible workflow when working with data in R. We will install and load packages, load data, perform some operations on this data, calculate some summary statistics and plot them. In later chapters, we will go into a little more depth for each topic, so don’t worry if you don’t understand something quite yet, it will be covered again in later chapters.\n\n\nPackages are extensions to the base R you get by default. Let’s install a package collection, that makes it easier to work with data in R:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nThe tidyverse is a collection of packages following a common philosophy, and facilitating many aspects of coding in R. We will use functions from base R and from the tidyverse. However, as I personally find them a bit more intuitive in many cases, we will use tidyverse functions a lot in the current chapter, so you can quickly get an insight into what is possible with R.\n\n\n# tidyverse code will be marked like this.\n\n\nJust by installing the packages, we can’t use them. We also have to load them into our R session:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.2     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.2     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.1     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\n\nData is loaded into R so you can work with it. For this chapter, we are going to use the data set babynames, which we can find on the tidytuesday site. I have already tweaked the data set a bit, so download it from here in case you want to follow along. Right-click on the respective data set found under this link, select ‘save as’ and then choose a folder on your notebook where to save it. We have talked about where that optimally should be in Workflow: Exercises. Our goal is to look at the most common name in every year and make a nice plot out of it.\nSo, after downloading it and saving it in the folder raw_data within my project directory, I can load the data set into R with:\n\nbabynames &lt;- read.csv(\"./raw_data/babynames.csv\")\n\nThis will load the data into R and assigning it the name babynames by using the &lt;-. You can see the data popping up in your Environment pane on the upper right. Note that the file path might differ on your device, depending on where you saved your data.\n\n\n\nNow that we have our data loaded safely into R, we can get an overview with a multitude of commands. One of the most important ones might be head(), which will give us the first few rows of the data:\n\nhead(babynames)\n\n  year sex      name ID\n1 1880   F      Mary  1\n2 1880   F      Anna  2\n3 1880   F      Emma  3\n4   NA   F Elizabeth  4\n5 1880   F    Minnie  5\n6 1880   F  Margaret  6\n\n\nEspecially for bigger data sets, it might be more feasible to only look at the structure and not the whole data set:\n\nstr(babynames)\n\n'data.frame':   1924665 obs. of  4 variables:\n $ year: int  1880 1880 1880 NA 1880 1880 1880 1880 1880 1880 ...\n $ sex : chr  \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" \"F\" ...\n $ name: chr  \"Mary\" \"Anna\" \"Emma\" \"Elizabeth\" ...\n $ ID  : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n\n\nOn the left we can see the columns of this data.frame, named year, sex, names, and ID. On the right we see the first values in each column, for example 1880, 1880, 1880, NA etc … in the year-column.\nSo, what we can infer from the data and its online description is that it contains the most common names for boys and girls in the USA for each year since 1880.\n\n\n\nSadly the data is not complete. If we had the number of people named with each name every year, we could find out which name was the most common each year, and make a nice plot out of it. However, the number of people with the respective name each year is missing (ok, i split it up for illustrative purposes). So let’s download it and load it into R quickly:\n\nbabynames_n &lt;- read.csv(\"./raw_data/babynames_n.csv\")\n\nAnd now merge it with our other data set by the ID column:\n\nbabynames_merged &lt;- merge(babynames, \n                          babynames_n, \n                          by = \"ID\")\n\nhead(babynames_merged)\n\n  ID year sex      name    n       prop\n1  1 1880   F      Mary 7065 0.07238359\n2  2 1880   F      Anna 2604 0.02667896\n3  3 1880   F      Emma 2003 0.02052149\n4  4   NA   F Elizabeth 1939 0.01986579\n5  5 1880   F    Minnie 1746 0.01788843\n6  6 1880   F  Margaret 1578 0.01616720\n\n\nHold on! The column years seems to include missing values (NA's, see the cell on the top left). It is always a good idea to at least think about the missing values. before doing any analyses, so let’s do just that:\n\n\n\nThere are multiple ways to deal with missing values. For reasons of simplicity, we will just remove any rows that contain NA's. We can achieve that very easily using a function from the tidyverse (the package collection we installed at the beginning of this chapter):\n\n\nbabynames_merged &lt;- drop_na(babynames_merged)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne very important part of working with data in R is the subsetting of data. This means we select specific values from a data set. Let’s suppose we want to only look at the female names in this data set:\n\n\nbabynames_F &lt;- babynames_merged %&gt;%\n  filter(sex == \"F\")\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, we want to plot the percentages of each name, instead of the probability, because it looks a bit more intuitive. So, let’s build a new column named percentage, which is just the prop column multiplied by 100:\n\nbabynames_F$percentage &lt;- babynames_F$prop * 100\n\n\n\n\nNow we can trim down our data set a bit more and select only the columns we are actually going to need:\n\nbabynames_F &lt;- babynames_F %&gt;%\n  select(year, name, percentage)\n\n\n\n\nNow, the specifics of the next part are not really relevant. However, they can show you how easy it can be to deal with data in R, so follow along if you want to. First, let’s group our data according to year:\n\n\nbabynames_F_grouped &lt;- group_by(babynames_F, year)\n\n\nAny operations we now perform are performed by year, and not on the whole data set at once. In our case, we want to find the most common name each year, which is the name with the maximum percentage:\n\n\nbabynames_F_max &lt;- slice(babynames_F_grouped, which.max(percentage))\n\nhead(babynames_F_max)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n# Groups:   year [6]\n   year name  percentage\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  1880 Mary        7.24\n2  1881 Mary        7.00\n3  1882 Mary        7.04\n4  1883 Mary        6.67\n5  1884 Mary        6.70\n6  1885 Mary        6.43\n\n\n\nThe which.max(percentage) command finds the maximum percentage per year. slice() will extract the respective rows, so we have only the row contatining the most common name per year in the end.\nAs already mentioned, the specifics of these functions are not really relevant for now, but we need them for our final plot:\n\n\n\nWe will use the package ggplot2 (which is also part of the tidyverse) for plotting our data. It should be mentioned that Base R also has some powerful plotting functions, however, ggplot2 makes it very easy to build complex and beautiful plots.\nA ggplot is constructed from multiple layers, that can be laid over each other using the + operator.\nWe start with the function ggplot(), where we define our data and the x and y axes.\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(\n  data = babynames_F_max,\n  aes(\n    x = year,\n    y = percentage)\n  )\n\nWe can also define different colours for different groups. For example, if we want the bars to get filled with a colour corresponding to the name they are representing, we can do that:\n\np &lt;- ggplot(\n  data = babynames_F_max,\n  aes(\n    x = year,\n    y = percentage,\n    fill = name\n  )\n)\n\nNow that we have defined our aesthetics, we can add a geom-layer. This will make use of the data we have defined in ggplot() and plot some bars for us:\n\np &lt;- p +\n  geom_col()\np\n\n\n\n\nLet’s give the axes some more informative names and a title to the plot:\n\np &lt;- p +\n  ggtitle(\"Most common female name in the United States of America by year\") +\n  xlab(\"Birthyear\") +\n  ylab(\"Percentage of children given that name relative to total births\")\np\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to style the plot a bit, let’s add a predefined theme and a color palette:\n\np +\n  theme_bw() + # Theme\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") # Color palette\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would have many more options to style this plot further (for example we could sort the names in the Legend by order of appearance), but let’s keep it at that for now.\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial we have learned that R is a flexible tool for editing and plotting data. Of course, we barely scratched the surface. Therefore, we want to dive a bit deeper into each step. Either follow the course, or navigate to the chapters you are most interested in. But first, take a look at the new data set you will be working with throughout the exercises."

Go at it step by step: first find all elements in vec_num that are equal to 1000, and then add a comparison for the rest of the statement behind an | (or).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvec_num == 1000 | (vec_num &lt; sqrt(11) & vec_num &gt; log(1.001))\n\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE"
