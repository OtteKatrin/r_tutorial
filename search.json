    "text": "Now that we have completed our set up, let’s dive right into programming with R. In this chapter, we will go through a “mini-project”, which follows a typical workflow when working with data in R. We will install and load packages, load data, perform some operations on this data, calculate some summary statistics and plot them. In later chapters, we will go into a little bit more depth for each topic. If you want to have more in depth information instead of following the whole workflow first, you can also jump to the according chapter and read the theory. But make sure to come back to this chapter for the final exercise.\n\n\nPackages are extension to the `base R` you get when installing it."

It can be run in you browser, and provides the same functions and interface as if you were working with your own RStudio installation. And it’s free as well (at least 25 hours per month, but that should be more than enough for this workshop and probably for the following week).\n\nGo to posit Cloud.\nClick on GET STARTED.\nCreate an account (it’s free) and login.\nOn the upper right, click on New Project. This will create a new RStudio project, which you can use the same way as described in this tutorial.\n\n\n\nStructure of the RStudio interface\n\nScript Pane\n\n\nConsole\n\n\"Hello World!\"\n\n[1] \"Hello World!\"\n\n\nTadaa, we just wrote our first line of code."

Therefore, we want to write all our code that is worth saving into a script.\n\n\nRStudio Projects\nOver time, it will become increasingly hard to organize all your files, working directories and workspaces in a reasonable manner. For this, RStudio Projects can be used (highly recommended).\n\n\nExercises\n\nCreate a new folder for this tutorial, where all your files will go.\nCreate a new RStudio project and open it. Got to File - New Project - Existing Directory and select the path of the folder you created in step 1.\nCreate a new R Script by clicking on File - New File - R Script. Save it in you folder.\nTipp: Within your project folder create a folder named R, where all your R Scripts will go. You can do the same for data, plots etc. later on. This will help you to structure your working directory."

For now, please install that tutorial package by typing (and evaluating) the following code into your newly created R Script:\n\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"nickhaf/tutoR\")\n\nFor each chapter, there will be a short theory part. Most of the exercises can be run interactively with the tutoR package, but some will incourage you to use the RStudio environment, to get more familiar with it."
